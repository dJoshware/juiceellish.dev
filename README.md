# Playlister

#### Description:
Playlister makes creating, editing, and adding to playlists on Spotify a much smoother and faster experience. I found it very tedious to search for an artist, find their discography, select each individual album, and either add the whole album, or just a song or two, to your playlist(s). Album after album after album. It took too long. Especially when you like a lot of different people from a lot of different genres. So, I brought an idea to life and I believe this is how making playlists should be done!
